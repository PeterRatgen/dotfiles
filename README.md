# Repository for dotfiles

The vim setup uses Plug. Thus it is easy install all plugins  with `:PlugInstall` on the first start up. Plugins used are: coc.vim, seoul256 theme, vimtex, nerdtree, vim-fugitive, lightline theme for the status bar and autopairs which autocloses brackets.

I still need to implent a feature for jumping to after the next closing brqcket in vimscript.
